                </span>

                <span>17. Use the water you saved to drink for later.</span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  18. Double check that the faucet is completely off when
                  leaving the bathroom.
                </span>
                <br />

                <span>
                  23. Use the garbage disposal sparingly. Instead, compost
                  vegetable food waste and save gallons every time.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  24. Install an instant water heater near your kitchen sink so
                  you don’t have to run the water while it heats up. This also
                  reduces energy costs.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>

                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  26. Use good old soap instead of shower gels for bathing. Gels
                  require extra water for rinse off

                  27. Put food coloring in your toilet tank. If it seeps into
                  the bowl without flushing, there’s a leak. Fix it and start
                  saving gallons.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  28. If your toilet flapper doesn’t close properly after
                  flushing, replace it.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  29. Use a showerhead. They’re inexpensive, easy to install,
                  and can save you up to 750 gallons a month.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  30. Consider buying a dual-flush toilet. It has two flush
                  options: a half-flush for liquid waste and a full-flush for
                  solid waste.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  31. When washing your hands, turn the water off while you
                  lather.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  32. Install water-saving aerators on all of your faucets.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  33. Drop tissues in the trash instead of flushing them and
                  save water every time.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  34. One drip every second adds up to five gallons per day!
                  Check your faucets and shower heads for leaks.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  35. Monitor your water bill for unusually high use. Your bill
                  and water meter are tools that can help you discover leaks.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  36. Learn how to use your water meter to check for leaks.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  37. Grab a wrench and fix that leaky faucet. It’s simple,
                  inexpensive, and you can save 140 gallons a week.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  38. See a leak you can’t fix? Tell a parent, teacher,
                  employer, or property manager, or call a handyman.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  39. Adjust the lawn mower to the height of 1.5 to 2 inches.
                  Taller grass shades roots and holds soil moisture better than
                  short grass.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  40. Aerate your lawn periodically. Holes every six inches will
                  allow water to reach the roots, rather than run off the
                  surface.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>41. Avoid overseeding your lawn with winter grass.</span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  42. While fertilizers promote plant growth, they also increase
                  water consumption. Apply the minimum amount of fertilizer
                  needed.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  43. Water your summer lawns once every three days and your
                  winter lawn once every five days.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  44. Use a broom instead of a hose to clean patios, sidewalks
                  and driveways, and save water every time.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  45. Water coolers require a seasonal maintenance check. For
                  more efficient cooling, check your evaporative cooler
                  annually.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  46. If you have a cooler, direct the water drain to plants in
                  your landscape.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  47. Water audit your facility to find out your recommended
                  water use, then monitor your utility bills to gauge your
                  monthly consumption.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  48. Look into water recycling option at home and school
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>49. Use Rainwater harvesting techniques</span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  50. Avoid pouring out water from your drinking glass down the
                  drain
                </span>

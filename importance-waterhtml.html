            Why is saving water important?

          <br />
          <span>
            Well, for starters, the one that everyone knows: Human beings are
            60% water. Water is a vital part of our functioning, which is true
            for the rest of
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>
            life on this planet. Plants, animals, and the environment all need
            water to survive and function. Humans use water for just about
            everything, from
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>
            growing food, to sanitation, and recreation. Water is an important
            and essential part of every ecosystem on the planet, and when it’s
            damaged or
          </span>
          <br />
          <span></span>
          <span class="importance-waterhtml-text12">reduced</span>
          <span>
            , there are serious repercussions and consequences for human and
            animal life.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            Some people don’t realize that drinking water is a valuable and
            limited resource, and that conservation makes a huge difference.
            When you
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>
            conserve water, you ensure that there will be enough for people to
            use in your community. Prudent and economic use of water makes a
            huge
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>
            difference. Especially in times of drought, conservation helps make
            it so a given area has enough water to go around. Water scarcity is
            an
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>
            enormous problem in some parts of the world. While conserving water
            domestically isn’t going to necessarily help abroad, conserving
            locally can
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>
            make sure that your community has access to food and clean water for
            drinking, cleaning, hygiene, and sanitation in daily life.
          </span>

          <span>Food</span>
          <br />
          <span>
            Most of human water consumption goes towards agricultural
            production. Producing livestock, crops for human consumption, and
            crops for
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>
            livestock all require millions of gallons of water to feed the
            population of millions of people. Water is also necessary for food
            preparation— from
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>
            boiling water for your morning coffee, washing your fruits and
            veggies for lunch, to cooking a spaghetti dinner. And don’t forget
            about washing
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>
            your hands every time you handle food, or all the dishes left
            behind.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>Sanitation</span>
          <br />
          <span>
            Water is a key component of sanitation, and of waste management in
            many countries. What if you had to walk miles to retrieve clean
            water?
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>
            Imagine shaving or brushing your teeth without water, or having to
            share bath water with an entire household. It would be hard to have
            clean
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>
            dishes to eat off, or clean clothing to go about your day. These
            luxuries are not solely attributed to the convenience of indoor
            plumbing and other
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>
            technological advances—Indoor plumbing wouldn’t even be the
            convenience it is if there weren’t enough clean water for everyone
            to access.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>Saving Water Saves Money</span>
          <br />
          <span>
            Like we said, water is a limited and valuable resource (it literally
            makes life possible), and we have to pay for its use.
          </span>
          <br />
          <span>It’s not a huge expense,</span>
          <br />
          <span>
            but wasting water can really add up over time, because the water
            meter never stops counting.
